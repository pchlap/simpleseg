# SimpleSeg

An open-source, Python-based atlas-based segmentation framework.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This was originally developed on Linux (Ubuntu), although getting it to work on Windows/Mac should be fairly straightforward.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have Python (version 3) and a Python package manager (e.g. Pip, Conda). Next, you can install all of the required packages using the included list of Python packages.

```
pip install -r requirements-txt
```

### Included dataset

We have included a dataset in this repository, accessed from The Cancer Imaging Archive:

```
Aerts, H. J. W. L., Wee, L., Rios Velazquez, E., Leijenaar, R. T. H., Parmar, C., Grossmann, P., â€¦ Lambin, P. (2019). Data From NSCLC-Radiomics [Data set]. The Cancer Imaging Archive. https://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI
```

This dataset consists of non-contrast CT imaging of 60 lung cancer patients, with five organ-at-risk contours (heart, left lung, right lung, spinal cord, esophagus).

This collection may not be used for commercial purposes. This collection is freely available to browse, download, as outlined in the Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/. It is able to be shared and adapted. We have converted the original DICOM images and RT-STRUCT files into compressed NifTI files. We have also cropped the images to contain to the extent of the contours (to make deformable image registration more efficient).


### Demonstration

The SimpleSeg codebase is included (in the *code* directory), and a demonstration of how this code can be used for end-to-end segmentation is available in the *SimpleSeg.py* script.

Have a read of the *SimpleSeg.py* script, most of the settings are made to be user-understandable. At the bottom of the script, the target image is defined.

The script can be run in a terminal:

```
python SimpleSeg.py
```

### Measuring segmentation accuracy

We include a simple script to generate quantitative label similarity metrics, this is useful to evaluate the performance of an automatic segmentation algorithm. To run this script, in a terminal:

```
python ComputeMetrics.py
```
